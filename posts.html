			<h1>Beethoven's Ninth</h1>
			<p>The light shone dimly in the small upper-room attic. From a corner of the room the exultant cries of Ode to Joy emanated from a set of shabby-looking speakers, 
			conflicting wryly with the present mood in the room. Outside the rain pelted and shook the walls, a portentous indication of the lack of progress made that evening. 
			I sighed, running my hands through my hair in frustration. For the past hour I had done little but strain my ears for the slightest, most subtle hint of meaning in 
			the cryptic notes of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Yet to no avail. The mystery remained unsolved, and the conspiracy theorist within me was beginning to wonder if my 
			collegues had been right for once, that it was all a part of my imagination.</p>
			<p>Two months ago, I had begun to question the circumstances surrounding the great Beethoven’s death. In the midst of commissioning his tenth symphony, the revered 
			composer had suddenly passed away. To be fair, illness had struck him frequently throughout his entire life. And hadn’t he suffered from bouts of alcoholism? </p>
			<p>No. I knew better.</p>
			<p>They called it “the Curse of the Ninth”. The number was a benchmark that, once reached, induced fear and doubt in the hearts of even the most resilient composers. 
			“He who wants to go beyond it must pass away,” the composer Arnold Schoenberg had written. There certainly had to be some truth in that statement. Beethoven, Mahler, 
			Dvořák, Vaughan Williams, Schubert, and others had all been struck by this inauspicious fate. Mahler, fearful of the superstition, had even tried referring to his ninth 
			symphony work (a piece laden with images of death) as a “song-cycle” rather than a symphony, but as affirmation to the validity of the curse, he died after writing his 
			latter Ninth Symphony. To attribute the pattern as mere coincidence would be to give credence to folly. And yet, what was so terrible about this wretched ninth symphony? 
			Nothing, as far as I could tell. In truth, as my ears picked up the sweet, mellifluous notes drifting softly from the speakers, Beethoven’s ninth symphony had been magnificent. 
			I closed my eyes, letting the lull of the music carry me to a tranquil place. My thoughts grew muddled as tinny notes floated through my mind from a distance… </p>
			<p>In my dream, I sat in a plush brown armchair near the glowing fire of a small, private library. Situated in another armchair across from me was the great composer himself, 
			who appeared much younger than the portraits I remembered of him and no longer deaf as he had been in life. He seemed to be waiting for me to speak, silently appraising 
			me in a manner that suggested he was very bored. I cleared my throat before I began. “Mr. Beethoven, pardon me for being so direct –” He gave an imperceptible nod. </p> 
			<p>“The circumstances of your passing…were very unusual. With the uncanny timing of the deaths of later composers, some might call it coincidence, while others –well, 
			I’m sure you know all about the Curse.”</p>
			<p>Beethoven remained silent. The light from the fire flickered intensely in the reflection of his eyes. Finally he spoke, a hint of a German accent audible in his 
			otherwise fluent English. “Not many believe in the Curse of the Ninth. If I had known…” he shook his head. “But my time has long come and gone. What is it you would 
			like to know?”</p>
			<p>“What I want to know is this: what is it about the ninth symphony that is cursed? What lies beyond to which only death can surpass it?”</p>
			<p>“The answer lies in the number itself. It is an odd number, and odd numbers have a singular importance in this world. Why, there were three Fates in Greek mythology. 
			Religious texts often place certain emphasis on the numbers three, five, and seven. And there are seven notes in a musical scale. Have you heard of a Perfect Fifth?” 
			he asked, as if its musical significance provided more than ample proof of his conjecture. </p>
			<p>I nodded. “So, you believe the intrinsic nature of an odd number is what makes the odd number…odd. I still don’t understand exactly what that means. 
			Aren’t odd numbers just numbers that cannot be divided by two?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course. But go beyond the literal interpretation of oddness. Humans, in one sense, are “odd” creatures; not one of us is identical to another. Our idiosyncrasies, 
			oddities in themselves, are rooted within the oddness of nature. So it is no surprise that odd numbers hold their own sort of power. Why nine is the cursed number, I do not know. 
			Perhaps it being the product of the same odd number strengthens its importance?” </p> 
			<p>I nodded, still not entirely grasping his meaning. But, I had gleaned something from our discussion. I thanked Beethoven for his help in solving the mystery; he bowed 
			his head absentmindedly in return, his expression deeply pensive. From the side of the room the fire began to burn brighter, eclipsing the chamber in a white glow… </p>
			<p>I woke with a start, knocking over one of the speakers –but Beethoven’s Ninth had long since finished playing. </p>
